Both direct and indirect effects on human, plant and animal health are expected from climate change. Direct effects results from changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events like heatwaves and floods. Indirect effects can be felt through changes in the incidence of diseases transmitted by insects (i.e. vector born diseases caused by mosquitoes and ticks), rodents or changes in water, food and air quality."
