      "description": "Climate change will generate new health risks and amplify current health problems. Climate change brings changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events like heat waves and floods which have a direct impact on human health. There will also be indirect effects through the spread of disease bearing insects and changes in water, food and air quality.",

Agriculture is also a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions now and a potential contributor to negative emissions in the future. Consequently, both mitigation and adaptation are important in the agriculture sector. The Copernicus Climate Change Service will provide indices of both the impacts of climate change on the agricultural sector and of the emissions associated with the agricultural sector. Our initial range of indices relates to weather events which are likely to have an impact on crop yields.",
