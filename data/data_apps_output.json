The fire danger index allows the EFFIS to be compared with the Australian Mark5 rating system.</p>\n<p><strong>Definition</strong>\nThe fire danger index is a metric related to the chances of a fire starting, its rate of spread, its intensity, and its difficulty of suppression.  The fire danger index is calculated using the Australian McArthur (Mark 5) rating system. The fire danger model used to produce the dataset is the Global ECMWF Fire Forecast model (GEFF).
